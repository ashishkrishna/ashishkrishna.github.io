I built a gender non-conforming bathroom locator app for both Android Mobile and Wear platforms in my UI class. I wrote multithreaded code to run an automated drink maker that could process two concurrent drink making requests in my Embedded Systems class . I programmed at the systems level in my Operating Systems class by writing kernel code that managed the scheduling of threads, setting up user memory, as well as designing an entire file system which was inspired by UNIX. At the moment, I'm in the final stage of writing a compiler for the COOL (Classroom Object Oriented Language).</h2>
